Trying to implement a simple 2D physical engine with Rust and then simulate a control system to manipulate an inverted pendulum. 
The mathematical reasoning process was also provided, in the "extra" folder you can find the [model.pdf](https://github.com/BaiYouShiWo/inv_pendulum/tree/main/extra/model.pdf).
